    <h3>OEDIPUS.</h3>
    <p>What, all the prophecies of the gods, where are they? The man whom I feared, Polybus, has died...</p>

    <h3>MESSENGER.</h3>
    <p>Hear me, Oedipus, for I have brought news of joy: Polybus is dead!</p>

    <h3>OEDIPUS.</h3>
    <p>Dead, you say? How? By his own hand, or was it disease?</p>

    <h3>MESSENGER.</h3>
    <p>He died of old age and long years, not from any sickness.</p>

    <h3>JOCASTA.</h3>
    <p>[_Turning to the gods._] O hear this, and let us rejoice! The prophecies are false!</p>

    <h3>OEDIPUS.</h3>
    <p>[_Relieved._] At last, I am free from the prophecy that haunted me.</p>

    <h3>MESSENGER.</h3>
    <p>But, Oedipus, there is more to tell... you are not Polybus's true son.</p>
